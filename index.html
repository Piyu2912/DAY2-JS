    <p class="que">Explain var, let and const?</p>

    <p class="ans">There are three types of variables in javascript:</p>

    <ul class="ans">
        <li>
            <b>var</b>
            <ul>
                <li>var is Global or Functional Scoped.</li>
                <li>It can be reassigned, redeclared and modified later.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>let</b>
            <ul>
                <li>let is Block Scoped</li>
                <li>It can be modified later on.</li>
                <li>It cannot be reassigned and redeclared later on.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>const</b>
            <ul>
                <li>const is also block scoped like let.</li>
                <li>It cannot be reassigned, redeclared and modified later on.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="que">What is Hoisting?</p>

    <p class="ans">Hoisting is the default mechanism where our variables and functions declarations are moved up to top of their scope before code execution. </p>
    <p class="ans">Only declarations are hoisted not initializations.</p>

    <p class="que">What is Temporal Dead Zone?</p>

    <p class="ans">It is the time between the hoisting and the initialization of variables.
        Even let and const are hoisted but they are in different space called Temporal Dead Zone  </p>

    <p class="atten">Please look into the script file!!</p>
